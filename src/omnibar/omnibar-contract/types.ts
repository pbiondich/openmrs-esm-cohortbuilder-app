/**
 * The omnibar provider contract.
 *
 * A provider is an ordinary O3 extension attached to `omnibar-providers-slot`. It renders nothing.
 * The omnibar mounts it while the panel is open, passes it the current query and context as props,
 * and the provider calls `report` with what it found. Because providers are extensions, they get
 * lazy loading, privilege gating, feature flags, display expressions, and per-module config and
 * translations from the framework, and can use the same SWR hooks as the rest of their app.
 *
 * Providers describe results; the omnibar acts on them. A result can only point at a destination
 * (a URL or a workspace). There is deliberately no `onSelect` callback, so nothing in the bar
 * can write to the record directly: anything that changes data opens a form or workspace first.
 */
